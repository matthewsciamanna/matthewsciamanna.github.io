        <h3>A Philosophical Assessment in the Rejection of Negligence Satisfying Culpability</h3>
        <p>In May 2000, the town of Walkerton Ontario was embracing spring as heavy rain fell upon the small farming town for nearly four days. Shortly after, residents began to suspect something was amiss. During the Victoria Day long weekend, two-year-old Kody Hammel began to vomit uncontrollably. As Kody’s condition worsened, the local hospital denied the family entry as capacity had been met. To buy time, Mrs. Hammel was instructed by local doctors to do what she must to get water into her son, including to “get a syringe”.1 As Kody’s eyes rolled back into his head, he was brought to the hospital in which E. Coli was determined to have infected the young boy, similar to the rest of the patients. Kody ended up surviving his infection, however, the same can not be said for seven Walkerton residents.
As patients were discharged with copious prescriptions, questions of how this could have happened were posed. The point of contamination was deemed to be a farm in the southwest area of Walkerton in which after heavy rainfall, manure seeped into the well system. However, according to authorities, this particular farmer “followed proper practices and should not be faulted”.2 Focus then shifted to the Walkerton Public Utilities Commission (PUC) as a judicial inquiry was conducted by Chief Justice Dennis O’Connor. This inquiry identified that operators and brothers Stan and Frank Koebel failed to properly monitor the water purification process and routinely demonstrated carelessness. Both brothers would later be charged with negligence and evade the maximum sentence, receiving one year in jail and nine months of house arrest respectively.
The issue of negligence in culpability stumbles even the most esteemed philosophers of
law. Despite no wicked motive involved, carelessness can nonetheless cause harm. When I discussed this case with Justice O’Connor, he necessitated that the purpose of law was to deter the creation of ‘scorned’ individuals. In order to integrate offenders back into society, Justice O’Connor disagrees with purely punitive measures, thus rejecting the adage ‘eye for an eye’ and instead advancing rehabilitative principles. Given the precariousness and deadliness of these negligent acts, I believe it is worthwhile to assess the philosophical principles or frameworks utilized in law under this necessity to prevent the creation of scorned citizens. This paper will first give an exegesis of the Walkerton Inquiry conducted by Chief Justice O’Connor to establish the key components that led to the deaths of seven residents, the sickening of over two thousand, and the circumstances that denied the brothers from being charged with the maximum sentences. Subsequently, rehabilitative philosophies will be explicated as to get an understanding of the principles advanced in the sentencing of the Koebels. Next, this paper will analyze three philosophical interpretations of punishment ranging from the eighteenth century to the twenty-first to gain an expansive understanding.
After analyzing the facts and philosophical frameworks, I will conclude by arguing that Bentham offers the most useful justification for the sentencing of the brothers on account of three understandings. First, demonstrated throughout the Inquiry was the lack of malicious intent by the brothers, therefore the effects of those actions cannot be deemed malicious and subsequent punishment would be ineffective. Secondly, because Stan and Frank were unaware of circumstances that would result in a higher chance of mischief, both are deemed unconscious in their acts making punishment ineffective. Finally, I believe that punishment for the Koebel brothers would not be profitable because the brothers lived in Walkerton and drank their own untreated water. Therefore, both are in direct connection to the victims as they themselves could have been harmed, thus making punishment unprofitable under utilitarianism. In order to understand the verdict of Stan and Frank Koebel being found guilty of negligence and evading the maximum penalty, the facts of the case must first be determined. The Walkerton Inquiry was conducted shortly after residents became ill with two objectives: first, to analyze the weakness and mistakes in the water treatment system and identify those accountable; second, to prepare expansive recommendations to the water treatment sector to ensure that a similar tragedy would be avoided. The inquiry identified several parties and their roles that contributed to the outbreak, such as the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) operators and executives, the Ministry of the Environment, and the citizens of Walkerton.
The individuals found directly responsible were the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) operators and brothers Stan and Frank Koebel, whose role was to properly treat the water. Not only did the brothers maintain upper operating licenses giving them chief responsibility, but they lacked the necessary certification for these licenses as they had received them through “a voluntary grandparenting program for water operators”.3 Additionally, the brothers for years falsified operating records, including the chlorination and condition of the town water, which they knew was “unacceptable”.4 The ignorance of the brothers was apparent as they not only lived in Walkerton but also regularly consumed the water they would later toxify. The lack of chlorination of the Walkerton water was made partially due to residential complaints of its ‘chlorinated’ taste.5 The PUC operators complied as they themselves preferred the taste of the water lacking proper chlorination as it, “always tasted better than the treated [water]”.6 The training of the brothers was precarious, as the 40 hours of required training was interpreted liberally to include accompanying the Ministry of the Environment on tests of the wells, in addition to training new employees.7 Additionally, the superiors of the Koebels were completely unaware that their operators required training, as the $1,500 - $3000 allotted for it was never requested.8 Despite these clear violations of the operators, their failure was supported by the inadequate system of checks that were also determined to have a role in the outbreak.
One of these systems was the Ministry of the Environment (MOE) which failed in its duties to properly monitor the Walkerton plant. The MOE inspected the plant in 1991, 1995, and 1998, listing several deficiencies that went unresolved. Although the MOE threatened to take action, it never came.9 Additionally, the ministry was to conduct unexpected checks; which never occurred. Stan Koebel explained that he never experienced an “unannounced ‘spot check’ by MOE”, and instead was given a seven-day notice which allowed him to briefly make the plant ‘presentable’.10 Despite these various failures by the MOE, the ministry reported two years prior to the outbreak that E. Coli, “had been present in a significant number of treated water samples” and emphasized the need for proper chlorination as it identified serious deficiencies such as operators “not complying with the minimum sampling program, had only recently started to measure chlorine residuals in the distribution system, and was not maintaining proper training records”.11 However, the MOE failed to flag what would be the point of contamination of E. Coli two years later, and also failed to take action against the improper chlorination practices of the PUC operators.12 Despite the MOE issuing a report on the deficiencies they did find, the report went to the commissioners of the Walkerton plant, who were not only unfamiliar with terms such as ‘E.Coli’ and ‘Chlorine residual’ but were also unaware that the operators they managed were required by Ontario Regulation 435/93 to receive a minimum of 40 hours training annually.13
Although it was the role of the MOE to properly monitor the plants such as Walkerton, the range of which they could properly fulfill this role was diminished due to budget reductions. From 1992 until 1998, the MOE’s budget was reduced by a substantial 30% without their consideration. The ministry was instructed to “develop strategies” to fulfill its targets.14 The MOE in turn decided to “discontinue all routine testing of water for municipalities at provincial laboratories” and left the duty to the private sector which failed to meet the standards set by the ministry.15 Additionally, the budget reductions made the MOE less likely to pursue protective measures as their budget for inspections was diminished.
Leniency was later granted to the Koebels due to the wide variety of circumstances ranging from the commissioners being unaware of their duties, the MOE not properly fulfilling its duties, and the provincial budget cuts that created the system of ignorance in which the brothers operated. Despite the obvious lack of care taken by the brothers, it was not found that their intent was malicious. The justification was given in a two-hour explanation stressing that although the brothers were negligent in their duties, they themselves were “not being sentenced for being the cause of the Walkerton water tragedy”.16 With this rationale, Judge Durno sentenced Stand Koebel to a year in prison, and Frank Koebel to nine months of house arrest.17
Presently, the Walkerton Clean Water Centre is a point of pride for the once exposed town, which advances the imperative to educate, support, provide advice, and sponsor research on “systems to safeguard water resources”.18 This is in keeping with the several water treatment recommendations generated by the judicial inquiry, which exhibit the goal of future prevention has been achieved. Additionally, both brothers are again free citizens and have re-entered society as Frank Koebel continues to live in Walkerton, where he also spent his nine months of house arrest.19 However, disputes among residents are apparent. Those who lost family members and whose health was compromised sought criminal charges which never came.20 Others desire to simply move on from the incident, and focus on the progress of their community. However, tales of the outbreak seem inescapable, which led to the application for a $70,000 search engine optimization grant, that would replace the infamous reports of E. Coli with reports of town successes instead.21 Although more than two decades have passed, tales of the outbreak and dispute over what justice should entail have proven to be contentious. Therefore, I believe it is necessary to determine what philosophical framework justifies the leniency granted to the Koebels, given the disagreement among Walkerton Residents.
In order to determine the philosophical framework, rehabilitate and restorative philosophical frameworks advanced by Justice O’Connor must first be examined. Lacey and Pikard detail a retributivist model, in which punishment ought to be in proportion to the individual’s blameworthiness. In this instance, blameworthiness requires that the individual be of responsible agency in that they are, “minimally, cognitive and volitional capacities such that they knew what they were doing when they committed the offence, and exercised choice and a sufficient degree of control in doing so”.22 A strength of this model is the dialogue it advances between the victim and the guilty on the nature of the consequences, which parallels the process in which the inquiry was undertaken.23
A similar model is the restorative justice account from another pair of contemporary philosophers, Olson and Dzur. This account maintains that it is more effective than past processes at reducing crime, such as purely punitive accounts. This is due to advocates maintaining that harsher punishments would not deter would-be criminals and that incarceration for the guilty prevents them from re-entering society, which in turn hurts the community as a whole.24 This sentiment is also in keeping with the reasoning of Justice O’Connor, both of which reject revenge as justice.
Not only do both accounts dismiss punishment, but they both also dismiss the sentiment that the purpose of law is to punish. Lacey and Pikard acknowledge that the criminal justice system has the capacity to sentence punishments, however, it is equally capable of institutionalizing forgiveness.25 To expand, Lacey and Pikard maintain that law is merely an expression of its citizens' will. Typically when wronged, victims will naturally have negative emotions towards the offender. These sentiments translate to the institution of law, which results in harsh punishment and offenders becoming scorned. However, because this institution of punishment is merely an expression of emotion, Lacey and Pikard assert that law can also have the capacity to implement institutional forgiveness if the victims reject their negative emotions. Similarly, Olson and Dzur maintain that in order to make communities safer, their involvement is necessary in order to allow victims and their communities to foster a wider understanding.26
For the case of Walkerton, it is clear that rehabilitation and restoration were key goals of the judicial inquiry, as a 500-page clear strategy to obtain safe drinking water to prevent a similar crisis was created and implemented.27 However, despite these rehabilitative measures, both Koebel brothers were sentenced punishments not entirely explained by restorative and rehabilitative frameworks. Additionally, neither of these frameworks account for issues of negligence determining culpability. Therefore, accounts of punishment that corroborate rehabilitative measures, specifically in cases of negligence are required. A widely esteemed legal philosopher that can resolve cases of negligence is HLA Hart. Hart gives an expansive legal positivist framework in his Concept of Law, and explains the rules that govern society are primary rules and secondary rules. Primary rules instill obligations, of which the consequences for their disobedience are the ensuing punishments.28 What gives the sovereign the ability to punish are secondary rules which are statutes of another kind that allow for fluidity of law, such as the ability to adjudicate cases.29
However, Hart’s Punishment and Responsibility gave a thorough construction of his conception of punishment. Hart first explains what qualifies a criminal offense is an act that society rejects and announces that, “these actions are not to be done”, and requires their suspense for the future.30 What justifies these individuals for punishment is retribution, which Hart maintains may be included in, “the conceivable justifying aims of a system of punishment”.31 These two elements of retribution and deterring future crime are made clear through the law’s ‘General Justifying Aim’, which also sets out that punishment ought to be a “return for the harm done to others”.32 In other words, law ought to support retribution but, the punishment must correspond equally to the harm committed, otherwise, the benefits society will obtain from punishment will be diminished by the undue ‘evil’ of extreme punishment.
After explaining the role of punishment, Hart then begins to give an explanation of purposeful acts and the responsibility for those acts. Hart recognizes that when an individual acts, they are doing so with full knowledge and intention to commit these acts. However, a defect in human nature is identified, which is the inability to properly possess full knowledge and foresight which results in calamity.33 Hart gives the example of ‘Barrett’ who attempted to rescue his comrades from prison by using dynamite to blow open an escape route. However, the blast killed residents living nearby, which poses the question of whether Barrett killed intentionally.34 Although Barett foresaw the residents’ injury, it was not his intent to kill them. Nonetheless, he was found guilty of their murder under the justification that equal punishment is due, “if a man did [an] act not with the purpose of taking life but with the knowledge or belief that life by likely to be sacrificed by it”.35
The key aspect of intentionality according to Hart is that those who are rational agents have the capacity to foresee harms, therefore their failure to take measures to prevent those harms makes them equally culpable. Hart expands by explaining that cases that do not satisfy criminal responsibility are those in which there is a clear disconnect between an individual’s “mind and body”.36 These are cases in which an individual cannot control their movements, such as those who are epiliptic or suffer from mental illness, thus making them unaccountable for their actions or harms that follow.
However, this exemption given to those whose mind and body are suffering a 'disconnect' does not apply to cases of negligence. Hart identifies a necessary compromise made in the legal system which is an ‘objective standard’ that deems that an ordinary or reasonable individual who has capacities of self-control “would have exercised”.37 This objective standard maintains that psychological elements are not by themselves crucial to the aspect of responsibility. What is crucial is that those punished should have, when they acted, “the normal capacities, physical and mental, for doing what the law requires and abstaining from what it forbids, and a fair opportunity to exercise these capacities”.38 Thus, there is direct rational confidence the law can take when it evaluates individuals who could have evaluated their actions equally to individuals who intentionally commit wrong acts as both “could have done otherwise”.39
Additionally, Hart gives an account of Role-Responsibility, which is when an individual occupies a district purpose within an organization. This individual is responsible to ensure that the duties of their role are fulfilled, and doing what is necessary to fulfill these duties in order to promote the welfare of those within the organization.40 An individual enters this in some form of agreement, and he is consequently responsible to “take his duties seriously; to think about them, and make serious efforts to fulfill them”.41
Due to his accounts of negligence and role-responsibility, I believe Hart would find the Koebels guilty of the maximum sentence. This is first in part due to Hart’s rejection of negligence under an objective standard in that the brothers, because they are reasonable agents, should have acted otherwise. Therefore, because the brothers routinely falsified records, and failed in their duties makes them justified for the maximum punishment under the conception that a reasonable agent would not have done so. However, the lack of understanding the Koebels had was clear as they lacked complete comprehension of “important concepts” in the water treatment process.42 However, according to role-responsibility, the lack of understanding by the brothers does not justify their acts being unintentional. This is because role-responsibility requires that an individual take their positions earnestly to support the welfare of those that depend on them. The Koebels did not demonstrate that they took their roles seriously as they consistently showed a “serious disregard for MOE requirements and repeated failures”.43 Therefore, due to his concepts of the ‘objective standard’ and ‘role-responsibility’, I believe Hart would not find this case justified for negligence.
Unlike Hart, Jeremy Bentham and his utilitarian framework have a more accommodating account of negligence. Bentham maintained that what dictates justice is the combined utility of a community, which is advanced through acts that produce “benefit, advantage, please, good, or happiness”.44 Consistent with these commitments, Bentham also explicates that acts that diminish the aggregate pain of the community are also correct acts.45 This view of fulfilling acts to produce the most benefit exemplifies his framework of utilitarianism.
However, punishment for Bentham is problematic. This is because punishment itself is an evil act inflicted on an individual, which thus diminishes utility.46 Therefore, Bentham maintains that punishment ought to “do no more mischief than is necessary”, so as to not create more harm than the one being found guilty.47 Bentham gives various exceptions to punishment, as it produces harm which can diminish aggregate utility. Bentham begins by explaining that the role of government is to “promote the happiness of the society, by punishing and rewarding”48. How Bentham determines whether a case ought to be meant for punishment is by considering four articles: The act itself, The circumstances of which the act was done, Intentionality, and The consciousness, unconsciousness, or false consciousness that may have been present.49 Once these factors are accounted for, it may become clear that some cases may be unjustified for
