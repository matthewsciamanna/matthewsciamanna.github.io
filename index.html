          <h3>A Philosophical Assessment in the Rejection of Negligence Satisfying Culpability</h3>
          <p>In May 2000, the town of Walkerton Ontario was embracing spring as heavy rain fell upon the small farming town for nearly four days. Shortly after, residents began to suspect something was amiss. During the Victoria Day long weekend, two-year-old Kody Hammel began to vomit uncontrollably. As Kody’s condition worsened, the local hospital denied the family entry as capacity had been met. To buy time, Mrs. Hammel was instructed by local doctors to do what she must to get water into her son, including to “get a syringe”.1 As Kody’s eyes rolled back into his head, he was brought to the hospital in which E. Coli was determined to have infected the young boy, similar to the rest of the patients. Kody ended up surviving his infection, however, the same can not be said for seven Walkerton residents.
As patients were discharged with copious prescriptions, questions of how this could have happened were posed. The point of contamination was deemed to be a farm in the southwest area of Walkerton in which after heavy rainfall, manure seeped into the well system. However, according to authorities, this particular farmer “followed proper practices and should not be faulted”.2 Focus then shifted to the Walkerton Public Utilities Commission (PUC) as a judicial inquiry was conducted by Chief Justice Dennis O’Connor. This inquiry identified that operators and brothers Stan and Frank Koebel failed to properly monitor the water purification process and routinely demonstrated carelessness. Both brothers would later be charged with negligence and evade the maximum sentence, receiving one year in jail and nine months of house arrest respectively.
The issue of negligence in culpability stumbles even the most esteemed philosophers of law. Despite no wicked motive involved, carelessness can nonetheless cause harm. When I discussed this case with Justice O’Connor, he necessitated that the purpose of law was to deter the creation of ‘scorned’ individuals. In order to integrate offenders back into society, Justice O’Connor disagrees with purely punitive measures, thus rejecting the adage ‘eye for an eye’ and instead advancing rehabilitative principles. Given the precariousness and deadliness of these negligent acts, I believe it is worthwhile to assess the philosophical principles or frameworks utilized in law under this necessity to prevent the creation of scorned citizens. This paper will first give an exegesis of the Walkerton Inquiry conducted by Chief Justice O’Connor to establish the key components that led to the deaths of seven residents, the sickening of over two thousand, and the circumstances that denied the brothers from being charged with the maximum sentences. Subsequently, rehabilitative philosophies will be explicated as to get an understanding of the principles advanced in the sentencing of the Koebels. Next, this paper will analyze three philosophical interpretations of punishment ranging from the eighteenth century to the twenty-first to gain an expansive understanding.
After analyzing the facts and philosophical frameworks, I will conclude by arguing that Bentham offers the most useful justification for the sentencing of the brothers on account of three understandings. First, demonstrated throughout the Inquiry was the lack of malicious intent by the brothers, therefore the effects of those actions cannot be deemed malicious and subsequent punishment would be ineffective. Secondly, because Stan and Frank were unaware of circumstances that would result in a higher chance of mischief, both are deemed unconscious in their acts making punishment ineffective. Finally, I believe that punishment for the Koebel brothers would not be profitable because the brothers lived in Walkerton and drank their own untreated water. Therefore, both are in direct connection to the victims as they themselves could have been harmed, thus making punishment unprofitable under utilitarianism.
